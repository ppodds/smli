# smli

A mini-LISP interpreter written in Rust. This is a term project for the course "Compiler" in National Central University. Also, it is my first Rust project. I'm still learning Rust, so the code may not be idiomatic. Currently, it only support a subset of LISP, and it also contains some bugs. I will fix them in the future.
